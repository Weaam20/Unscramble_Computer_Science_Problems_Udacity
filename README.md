# Project 1 | Unscramble Computer Science Problems

### Description :
In this project, we have two .csv files we have to do some tasks on these files.

### The files :
- The first file (calls.csv) contains (5213) records of all calls with caller and receiver number the date and time of the call and the number 
of seconds spent on the call.
- The second file (texts.csv) contains (9072) records of all texts with sender and receiver number  and the date of the message.

### The tasks :

- **Task 0 :**  What is the first record of texts? what is the last record of calls?
- **Task 1 :**  What is the number of the longest call that received during Septemper?
- **Task 2 :**  Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone during the period? Don't forget that time spent answering a call is also
 time spent on the phone.
- **Task 3 :** 

        (080) is the area code for fixed line telephones in Bangalore.Fixed line numbers include parentheses, so Bangalore numbers have the form (080)xxxxxxx.)

         Part A : Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people in Bangalore. In other words, the calls were initiated by "(080)" area code to the following area codes and mobile prefixes:

                - Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area codes vary in length but always begin with 0.
   
                - Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle of the number to help readability. The prefix of a mobile number is its first four digits, and they always start with 7, 8 or 9.
   
                - Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but they start with the area code 140.
 
         Part B : What is the percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore to fixed lines as well in Bangalore?
         
- **Task 4 :** The telephone company wants to identify numbers that might be doing telephone marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers: 
these are numbers that make outgoing calls but never send texts, receive texts or receive incoming calls.
