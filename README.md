# Project 1 | Unscramble Computer Science Problems

### Description 
In this project, we have two .csv files we have to do some tasks on these files.

**Files** 
- The first file was (calls.csv) contains (5213) records of all calls with caller and receiver number the date and time of the call and the number of seconds spent on the call.
- The second file was (texts.csv) contains (9072) records of all texts with sender and receiver number  and the date of the message.

### Tasks

- **Task 0 :**  What is the first record of texts and what is the last record of calls?
- **Task 1 :**  Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone during the period?
- **Task 2 :**  Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone during the period? Don't forget that time spent answering a call is also time spent on the phone.
- **Task 3 :** 

        (080) is the area code for fixed line telephones in Bangalore.Fixed line numbers include parentheses, so Bangalore numbers have the form (080)xxxxxxx.)

         Part A : Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people in Bangalore. In other words, the calls were initiated by "(080)" area code to the following area codes and mobile prefixes:

                - Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area codes vary in length but always begin with 0.
   
                - Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle of the number to help readability. The prefix of a mobile number is its first four digits, and they always start with 7, 8 or 9.
   
                - Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but they start with the area code 140.
 
         Part B : What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made to fixed lines also in Bangalore? In other words, of all the calls made from a number starting with (080)", what percentage of these calls were made to a number also starting with "(080)"?
   
- **Task 4 :** The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing telephone marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers: these are numbers that make outgoing calls but never send texts, receive texts or receive incoming calls.
